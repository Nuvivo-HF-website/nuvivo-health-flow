# Privacy Policy & Data Protection

## Overview

This document outlines our privacy practices, data protection measures, and user consent requirements for AI-powered medical analysis features.

## Data Collection & Processing

### Medical Data Processing
- **Test Results**: We process anonymized blood test results to provide AI-powered summaries
- **Personal Information**: Names, dates of birth, NHS numbers, and addresses are **never** sent to external AI services
- **Anonymization**: Only approved medical test names and values are processed (Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, TSH, Glucose, HbA1c, WBC, RBC, Platelets)

### AI Consent Requirements
Users must explicitly consent to AI processing before any medical data analysis occurs. This consent:
- Can be enabled/disabled at any time in user profile settings
- Is required for each AI summary generation
- Covers only anonymized medical test data processing

## Azure OpenAI Integration

### Regional Compliance
**IMPORTANT**: All Azure OpenAI resources MUST be created in EU regions to ensure GDPR compliance:

```bash
# Required: Use EU regions only
# Recommended regions:
- West Europe (Netherlands)
- North Europe (Ireland)
- France Central
- Germany West Central

# Example Azure CLI command:
az cognitiveservices account create \
  --name "your-openai-service" \
  --resource-group "your-rg" \
  --location "westeurope" \
  --kind "OpenAI" \
  --sku "S0"
```

### Data Processing Safeguards
1. **No PII Transmission**: Personal identifiers are filtered before API calls
2. **Test Filtering**: Only approved medical tests are processed
3. **Prompt Anonymization**: System prompts explicitly state data is anonymized
4. **Logging Restrictions**: Only response snippets (200 chars max) are stored, never full prompts

## User Consent Text

### AI Insights Consent
When users enable AI insights, they see this consent text:

> **Enable AI Insights**
> 
> I consent to the processing of my anonymized blood test results using AI technology to generate patient-friendly summaries. I understand that:
> 
> - Only approved medical test values will be processed
> - My personal information (name, date of birth, NHS number, address) will never be shared with AI services
> - AI summaries are for educational purposes only and do not replace professional medical advice
> - I can withdraw this consent at any time in my profile settings
> - Data processing occurs in EU regions in compliance with GDPR
> 
> **This is not a diagnosis; always consult your GP for medical advice.**

### Data Retention
- **AI Summaries**: Stored indefinitely as part of medical records
- **AI Logs**: Response snippets stored for audit purposes (no prompts or PII)
- **Consent Records**: Tracked with timestamps for compliance

## Technical Implementation

### Anonymization Process
```typescript
// Only these tests are allowed for AI processing
const allowedTests = new Set([
  'Cholesterol', 'HDL', 'LDL', 'TSH', 'Glucose', 
  'HbA1c', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'Platelets'
]);

// PII fields are never included
const excludedFields = [
  'patient_name', 'dob', 'nhs_number', 'address',
  'full_name', 'email', 'phone', 'postcode'
];
```

### System Prompt Template
```
"You are a clinical assistant generating short, non-alarming patient-friendly 
summaries from ANONYMISED lab values only. NEVER ask for or infer identity. 
Output 2â€“4 sentences, avoid jargon, include one next step like 'discuss with 
your GP'. At the end add: 'This is not a diagnosis; consult your GP.'"
```

### Audit Logging
```typescript
// Only response snippets are logged, never prompts
await supabase.from('ai_logs').insert({
  result_id: resultId,
  model: 'azure-openai',
  response_snippet: aiSummary.slice(0, 200), // Max 200 chars
  created_at: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## User Rights (GDPR Compliance)

### Right to Access
Users can view all their AI summaries and consent history through their patient portal.

### Right to Rectification
Users can update their consent preferences at any time.

### Right to Erasure
Users can request deletion of:
- AI summaries (while preserving original test results)
- AI processing logs
- Consent history

### Right to Data Portability
Users can export their medical data including AI summaries in structured format.

### Right to Object
Users can withdraw AI consent immediately, preventing future AI processing while preserving existing summaries.
